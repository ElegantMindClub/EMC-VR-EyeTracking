# EMC-VR-Eye-Tracking

Repository for 2023 Spring EMC Group 16: VR Eye Tracking

We are investigating how our eyes track moving objects, and how long it takes for us to react and adjust to unexpected changes in movement of objects that we are tracking. We predict that when objects move in unexpected ways, it will take us about 400 ms to realize and adjust our eyes to fixate back on the object. Further, during those 400 ms our eyes will continue to move the direction we predicted the object would go. Additionally, gradual/less steep changes are easier for our eyes to adjust to than immediate ones due to the unexpected nature of them. As a result, the time it takes to fixate our vision after a gradual change will be significantly less than an unexpected one (for the second part of our hypothesis, we have not had the time to research this topic yet).

In this repository, you will find out Unity project that we used to conduct the experiment and collect data. You will also find the scripts we used to clean our data and plot our data for investigation and analysis.
